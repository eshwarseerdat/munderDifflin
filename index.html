                <br>
                "Today is Thursday. But Dwight thinks that it’s Friday…and that’s what I will be working on this afternoon"

                <strong>Pamela "Pam" Morgan Susan Halpert (née Beesly):</strong> Pam is profoundly nearsighted (she states in that her vision is 20/400). She usually wears contacts but has a pair of backup glasses when the need arises.
                <br>
                Pam has worked at Dunder Mifflin since March 2002

                <br>
                "It all seems so very arbitrary. I applied for a job at this company because they were hiring, I took a desk in back because it was empty. But no matter how you get there or where you end up, human beings have that miraculous gift to make that place home... Alright Boys, Let's do this"
